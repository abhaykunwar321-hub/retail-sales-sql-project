# Retail Sales SQL Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a *Retail Sales Analysis* built using *MySQL*.  
The dataset is designed to simulate a retail sales environment with customers, products, and orders.  
The project demonstrates how to use SQL for *data modeling, querying, and business insights*.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
- Create relational tables with proper constraints.
- Insert sample retail sales data.
- Perform SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
- Use aggregate functions, joins, and filtering.
- Demonstrate real-world analytics scenarios.


- Delhi has the highest number of orders.
- Hyderabad recorded the lowest orders.
- Average order value across all transactions is â‚¹X (calculated).
- Customers like Rahul Sharma and Priya Singh placed multiple orders.
